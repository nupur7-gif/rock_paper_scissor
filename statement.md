#### Rock Paper Scissors Game



##### 🔍 Overview



This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, where a player competes against the computer. The computer makes a random selection each round, and the winner is determined through standard game rules.





##### 🎯 Objective



The objective of this project is to:



Demonstrate basic game logic



Practice programming fundamentals such as input handling, conditionals, and randomness



Provide a simple, interactive game experience



Build a foundation that can be expanded with additional features such as scoring or a graphical interface





##### 🧠 Game Rules



The game follows the traditional rules:



Rock beats Scissors



Scissors beats Paper



Paper beats Rock



If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the result is a draw





##### 🏗️ Implementation Summary



The game is built using simple logic:



The player chooses between Rock, Paper, or Scissors



The computer generates a random choice



A comparison function determines the winner based on predefined rules



The result is displayed to the player



The player may choose to play again





##### 🛠️ Tools \& Technologies



The project can be implemented using any basic programming language such as:



Python



JavaScript



Java



C++



Any language that supports user input and random number generation



(You can update this section to the specific language you used.)





##### 💡 Future Enhancements



Possible improvements include:



Adding a score counter



Creating a GUI or web-based interface



Adding sound or animations



Implementing difficulty levels



Adding multiplayer support





##### 📌 Conclusion



This project is a beginner-friendly way to learn core programming concepts and create an interactive game. It serves as a solid foundation for further development and enhancements.
